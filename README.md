# Audio Steganography with RSA

## Overview

This project demonstrates the implementation of audio steganography using the RSA (Rivest–Shamir–Adleman) encryption algorithm. Steganography is the practice of concealing one piece of information within another to hide its existence. In this case, we hide a message within an audio file using RSA encryption for secure communication.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- pip (Python package installer)
- cryptography library: `pip install cryptography`
- numpy library: `pip install numpy`
- wave library (for audio file handling): `pip install wave`

## Usage

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/audio-stego-rsa.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd audio-stego-rsa
   ```

3. Run the steganography script:

   ```bash
   python steganography.py
   ```

4. Follow the on-screen instructions to choose whether to encode or decode, provide necessary inputs, and execute the desired operation.

## File Structure

- `steganography.py`: Main script that implements audio steganography using RSA encryption.
- `audio_samples/`: Directory containing sample audio files for testing.
- `README.md`: Documentation file providing information about the project.

## How it Works

1. **Key Generation**: RSA keys (public and private) are generated using the `cryptography` library.

2. **Encoding**: The message is encrypted using the RSA public key and then embedded into the audio file.

3. **Decoding**: The embedded message is extracted from the audio file, and decryption is performed using the RSA private key.

4. **Demo Audio Files**: The `audio_samples/` directory contains sample audio files that can be used for testing the steganography process.

## Acknowledgments

This project is inspired by the principles of RSA encryption and audio steganography. Special thanks to the `cryptography` library for providing a convenient implementation of the RSA algorithm.
